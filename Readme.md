## Overview
This project provides a data-driven framework for the city engineering office to optimize pavement maintenance schedules and improve resource allocation. By analyzing key road characteristics, we identify and prioritize road segments that are in urgent need of maintenance.
## Dataset
The analysis is based on the ESC 12 Pavement Dataset.csv file, which contains information on various road segments, including their physical condition, traffic volume, and maintenance history.
