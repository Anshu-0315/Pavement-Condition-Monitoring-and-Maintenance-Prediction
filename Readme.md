## Overview
This project provides a data-driven framework for the city engineering office to optimize pavement maintenance schedules and improve resource allocation. By analyzing key road characteristics, we identify and prioritize road segments that are in urgent need of maintenance.
## Dataset
The analysis is based on the ESC 12 Pavement Dataset.csv file, which contains information on various road segments, including their physical condition, traffic volume, and maintenance history.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear, data-driven framework for the city engineering office to prioritize maintenance efforts. The findings on PCI, AADT, distress indicators, and Maintenance Age can be used to develop a predictive model that identifies which road segments are at the highest risk of deterioration. This approach allows for proactive maintenance planning, ensuring efficient use of resources and improving overall road network quality.
